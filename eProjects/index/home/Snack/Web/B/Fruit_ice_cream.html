    <p class="d1">&#9656; Detailed recipe: </p>
    <p>Step 1:</p>
    <pre>        - Wash the fruit and pat dry each fruit with a paper towel.
        - Fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, mulberries, etc., remove the stem. Mango, melon ... peeled, cut into bite-sized pieces. Peel bananas and leave them whole to avoid bruising. 
      For watery fruits like passion fruit, take the pulp and put it in a separate jar.
        - Next, you arrange the fruit in a box, put it in the freezer until it all turns to ice.</pre>

    <p>Step 2:</p>
    <pre>        - After checking that the fruit is completely frozen, take it out and put it in a blender, add yogurt and puree (you can combine fruits as you like). In particular, bananas help balance 
      acid levels very well.
        - The trio of strawberries, mulberries, and bananas give a sweet, light aroma. Mango and passion fruit when blended with banana will be less sour. And cantaloupe and banana for 
      sweet taste, easy to eat.
        - After blending, pour the mixture into a box or ice cream popsicle mold.</pre>
   
    <p>Step 3:</p> 
    <pre>        - Finally, you freeze for about 1 hour to complete the sweet and fragrant ice cream. You can add a little condensed milk, or sugar if you like it sweeter or fatter.</pre>          
                
    <p>=><i>After completing the above steps, you will be able to enjoy a bowl of delicious ice cream.</i></p>
