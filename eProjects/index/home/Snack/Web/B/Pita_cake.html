          - Cover with PE film and incubate one more time.
          - Sprinkle flour on a rolling pin to prevent sticking.
          - After the dough has rested, use a rolling pin in the shape of an X to make the cake even and thin.</pre>

          - After letting the chicken shrink to help keep the water inside for about 7-10 minutes, continue to bake until the chicken is cooked.</pre>
