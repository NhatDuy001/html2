    <p class="d1">&#9656; Detailed recipe:</p>
    <pre>     - After buying chicken, wash it, wash it with salt water to eliminate odors, then rinse with clean water and dry. 
    You can lightly boil the chicken with boiling water, take it out and cut it into bite-sized pieces. 
     - Marinate chicken with 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 tablespoon monosodium glutamate, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1 tablespoon 
    sugar, and a little cooking oil, smashed onions, mix well and let the chicken rest for 30-45 minutes to absorb the flavor.
     - Ginger with the skin on, wash thoroughly under water to remove dirt, thinly sliced.
     - Put the pan on the stove, add the cooking oil to heat, when the oil is hot, add the shallot, minced garlic, and fry until 
    fragrant, add the ginger part (at this time you should let the heat be a bit high),
     - Put the chicken in and stir well, season to taste to suit your taste. Add 1/2 cup of water, cover for 5 minutes. When the 
    chicken starts to hunt again and changes color, lower the heat to low, then add the ginger and stir well for about 2-4 minutes. 
    When the chicken is completely cooked, you can add the chopped scallions, gently stir and then turn off the heat.
     - Put the chicken on a plate, pour the broth over and sprinkle some ground pepper to complete the dish.</pre>
