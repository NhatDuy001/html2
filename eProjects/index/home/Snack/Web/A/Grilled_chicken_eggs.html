    <p class="d1">&#9656; Detailed recipe: </p>
    <p>Step 1: Remove the yolk and white from the egg:</p>
    <pre>     - To make baked eggs, you must first remove the yolks and whites from the shells while keeping them intact.
     - There are 2 ways: 
         + The first way is to use or stick a small hole in the top of the egg, then remove the suction cylinder from the shell.
         + The second way is to use a knife or spoon with a sharp tip, a small hole on the tip of your little finger on the sharp 
        end of the chicken egg, use the storage inside, then have the red egg outside.</pre>

    <p>Step 2: Add seasoning:</p>
    <pre>     - After attracting eggs, you use them evenly and filter the eggs through or filter bag to remove any leftover whites or eggshells. 
    For those of you who have a cylinder, use the cylinder to suck the spiced eggs and then return each one.
     - If a syringe is not available, use a small funnel, pouring back from the seasoned egg.</pre>

    <p>Step 3: Steam and bake eggs:</p>
    <pre>     - After putting the finish back into the shell, we proceed to absorb it from 12 to 15 minutes until the eggs are just cooked. 
    Then bake until the eggs are fragrant and the crust is slightly burnt.
     - When eating, you should dip the chicken with salt and pepper mixed with a little chili and rules, add a little more laksa leaves 
    to increase the flavor. The taste of fatty eggs and the special aroma grilled on a charcoal stove makes you want to eat forever.</pre>
