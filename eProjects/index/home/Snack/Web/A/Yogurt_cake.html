    <p class="d1">&#9656; Detailed recipe: </p>
    <p>Step 1: Make the Cake Filling:</p>
    <pre>     - Prepare a clean bowl or bowl, put unsweetened yogurt, sweetened condensed milk into the bowl, and stir well. Add the 
    mayonnaise to the mixture and continue stirring until the mixture is uniform.
     - Put a non-stick pan on the stove, pour the mixture into the pan and cook on low heat until the mixture gradually warms up. 
    While waiting, you put the cornstarch in a small bowl with the prepared amount of water and stir it into a homogeneous mixture.
     - When you see the cake mixture boiling, you add the cornstarch made, stir the mixture. Continue to cook until the mixture 
    becomes a thick mixture, then turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool and then place in the fridge for about 2 hours.</pre>

    <p>Step 2: The Cake Crust:</p>
    <pre>     - The sandwich bread makes the crust, you cut off the edge of the cake. Then place each piece of cake on a dry flat surface or 
    a cutting board, use a rolling pin to flatten the bread so that they form a flat piece.</pre>

    <p>Step 3: Step into Cake:</p>
    <pre>     - Take out the cake, use a silicone brush to spread a thin layer of yogurt cake on 3 edges of the cake, and then fold the cake 
    in half. Use a fork to press the edges of the cake together to form a bag-like shape.</pre>

    <p>=><i> After completing the above steps, you have yourself a delicious and greasy cake.</i></p>
