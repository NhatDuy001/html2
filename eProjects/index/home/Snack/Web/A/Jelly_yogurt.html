    <p class="d1">&#9656; Detailed recipe: </p>
    
    <pre>     - You pour fresh milk and condensed milk into a saucepan and simmer until the temperature reaches about 50-60&#176;C. Be careful not to let the milk boil.
     - Pour the yogurt into the pot and serve when the yogurt and milk are combined.
     - Soak the jelly to dissolve completely and then pour it into the cabinet that has just been prepared.
     - Then you scoop milk into prepared boxes or jars. Close the lid and put it in the incubator.
     - You can keep it in the yogurt maker for 5-8 hours. If you do not have a yogurt maker, you can brew it in a rice cooker using warm water at a temperature of 60-70&#176;C.
     - After incubation, you keep the flexible yogurt in the refrigerator to eat gradually.</pre>
